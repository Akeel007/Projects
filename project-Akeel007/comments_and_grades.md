Distributed computing methods: the project report contains information about applying different machine learning algorithms in PySpark, run on Microsoft Azure; the report also discusses Bayesian linear regression, providing a code that is not run

Overview of the underlying principles and methods: some of the principles are explained some are not; the notebook uses machine learning algorithms that have not been covered in class and does not provide the underlying background for these algorithms, in particular, about their distributed implementation

Implementation and running at scale: the code is implemented in PySpark, run on Microsoft Azure, the dataset used his of small size

Reproducibility: yes, it looks like

Presentation: the presentation is good with respect to combining code with explanations in text, and data visualisations; the structure of the notebook could be improved; the goals should be clearly stated; unclear why having the part on Bayesian linear regression why this is not tested

References: a good set of references is provided at the end

Additional comments:
* What is reported in the notebook deviates from the original goals â€“ the original goal was to evaluate the online Bayesian linear regression algorithm in the Spark stream processing framework; the notebook delivers very little with respect to the original goal
* The choice of the dataset is not fully justified for a project on distributed computing for big data
