"The following points should be noted about operational statistics covered by this publication:",
,
,
"Practical driving test results are largely reliant upon manual entry and any information we produce is dependent upon the accurate and timely entry of this data. To allow for sufficient time to record results, operational statistics are not produced until at least six weeks after the end of the reporting period. 
",
"Please note that all statistics are provisional until information for the whole financial year is published. Until that point, data for months / quarters from within the current financial year can be revised. ",
"Low numbers within a particular data set must be treated with caution as they may not fully reflect the candidate characteristics being reported upon; any conclusions drawn will therefore not be statistically robust or reliable for any form of analysis or comparison e.g. comparing performance of a test centre where less than 100 tests were conducted against a test centre where over 1,000 were conducted.  In some cases, the information supplied for each test centre will not show the full range of data available as it has been withheld to prevent the identification of individuals and this should also be considered when making any comparative analysis. If there is a risk of any information being linked to an individual, this information has been withheld and is indicated by ‘..’.  Wherever possible, this information will be included in test centre totals and is always included in the National totals.


",
,
"Test centre based statistics – Any statistics produced showing test centre level data will not include any centres where only one examiner has conducted that category of testing, but these tests will be included in the National Totals shown on each report.  Whilst requests for individual driving examiner statistics will be considered on a case by case basis, information which would lead to the identification of an individual examiner’s pass and fail rates has previously been withheld under the Freedom of Information Act, Section 36 exemption (prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs). The Information Commissioner’s Office have considered and upheld DSA’s application of this exemption.",
"National totals of tests conducted and passed by age groups can be found in report DRT0203 which can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/209181/drt0203.xls  ",
,
"Gender statistics - Any gender based statistics are based on recorded information. In the case of GB licence holders, details of gender are reliant upon the correct information being held on the DVLA database as this is our source.  ",
,
"Gender details about licence holders from other countries (such as Northern Ireland) are reliant upon information being captured accurately at the time of booking a test. In some cases, gender will not have been captured. Where a gender has not been captured these candidates will be recorded in total tests conducted there will therefore be small anomalies where the totals of gender do not match overall totals.",
,
"Closed test centres – Test centres which are now closed are identified with a ‘Z’ prefix/suffix",
,
"Changes to a driver's licence number will affect statistics run on the number of individuals in a specific category. The reports are based on driver licence number; when running a statistical report, a single individual who has changed licence number could be reported multiple times",
